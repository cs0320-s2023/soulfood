She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it."], "pid": 430, "liked_by": [127, 91, 21, 170, 42, 148, 1, 200, 96, 119, 106, 111, 118, 56, 192, 100, 44, 12, 57, 55, 43, 39, 168, 13, 22, 49, 109, 152, 179, 35, 67, 104, 121, 195, 174, 136, 51, 133, 156, 90, 63, 41, 110, 15, 153, 166, 143, 87, 185, 26], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1059943/pexels-photo-1059943.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:430", "posted_by": 53, "collected_by": [134, 42, 92, 70, 145]}, {"labels": ["American", "Food therapy", "Best Ramen Place", "Best for date", "Great restaurant"], "paragraph": ["In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.

Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents. which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.

This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.

Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love."], "pid": 497, "liked_by": [137, 179, 150, 175, 103, 80, 123, 79, 153, 81, 132], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/2102948/pexels-photo-2102948.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:497", "posted_by": 128, "collected_by": [156, 69, 157, 64, 49, 199, 172, 93, 51, 14, 50, 147, 95, 118, 146, 185, 71, 195, 61, 122, 103, 21, 30, 45, 76]}, {"labels": ["Thai", "Family made", "Best for birthday party", "Best for large groups", "Fast serving"], "paragraph": ["As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them."], "pid": 498, "liked_by": [147, 155, 67, 113, 30, 120, 177, 162, 165, 97, 49, 39, 117, 178, 26, 121, 45, 76, 156, 79, 5, 134, 88, 77, 80, 98, 28, 191, 23, 33, 174, 85, 86, 168], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1071878/pexels-photo-1071878.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:498", "posted_by": 109, "collected_by": [86, 155, 35, 189]}, {"labels": ["Labanese", "Family made", "Best for small groups", "Best Ramen Place"], "paragraph": ["\"My dear Madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.\""], "pid": 499, "liked_by": [193, 116, 106, 122, 134, 141, 124, 99, 12, 189, 162, 170, 38, 145, 78, 147, 80, 125, 5, 52, 82, 73, 177, 79, 173, 137, 64, 7, 188, 49, 104, 198, 102, 112, 39, 29, 18, 133, 57, 59, 8, 56, 89], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1435706/pexels-photo-1435706.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:499", "posted_by": 181, "collected_by": [13, 187, 184, 196, 81, 192, 109]}, {"labels": ["Spanish", "Food therapy", "Best for birthday party", "Great music", "Best for large groups"], "paragraph": ["Mr. Bennet made no answer."], "pid": 5, "liked_by": [68, 175, 177, 93, 82, 128, 101, 51, 6], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/958545/pexels-photo-958545.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:5", "posted_by": 25, "collected_by": [103, 168, 88, 146, 56, 47, 163, 80, 160, 63, 11, 35, 57, 40]}, {"labels": ["Thai", "Family made", "Best for birthday party", "Great servers"], "paragraph": ["\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.

Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;      and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When      she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it;      she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said      not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so      altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly      resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I      cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as      she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on      her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been      acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her      brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and      though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she      feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may      feel on his behalf, is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,      however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at      all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my      being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and      yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to      persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.

She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed,", "\"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\""], "pid": 635, "liked_by": [84, 91, 42, 90, 51, 89, 98, 177, 32], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/56007/jause-eat-delicious-food-56007.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:635", "posted_by": 97, "collected_by": [141, 149, 26, 65, 38, 63, 79, 104, 120, 98, 163, 146, 159, 174, 134, 37, 116, 154, 136, 196, 62]}, {"labels": ["Mexican", "Family made", "Best for large groups", "Drinks are good", "Line is too long", "Clean environment", "Good for brunch"], "paragraph": ["\"A little.\"", "\"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.

On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.

You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I      demand it of your justice.", "    \"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned      was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached      Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in      defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity,      ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr.      Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of      my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who      had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who      had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity,      to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could      be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But      from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally      bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in      future secured, when the following account of my actions and their      motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is      due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which      may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The      necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I      had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with      others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other      young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the      dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a      serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that      ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made      acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that      Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general      expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event,      of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I      observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then      perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had      ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.--Her look and      manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any      symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the      evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with      pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of      sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have      been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make      the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such      error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been      unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity      of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given      the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her      temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was      desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will      venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually      influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be      indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial      conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to      the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged      to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my      own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to      my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of      repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to      an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to      forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes      must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's      family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that      total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by      your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you. But amidst      your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your      displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you      consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to      avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally      bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to      the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that      from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was      confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy      connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon      returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His      sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our      coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible      that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly      resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly      went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to      my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and      enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it      would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been      seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your      sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his      affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has      great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment      than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived      himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,      was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for      having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the      whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is      that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to      conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as      it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant      of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is      perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough      extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this      concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however,      and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's      feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which      governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have      not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more      weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only      refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my      family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but      of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one      witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very      respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the      Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his      trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on      George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore      liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and      afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own      father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have      been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not      only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always      engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the      church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.      As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think      of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the      want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge      of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man      of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of      seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.      Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.      But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his      real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father      died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to      the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it      to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his      profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a      valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became      vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own      father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these      events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally      resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it      unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary      advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be      benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law,      and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would      be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than      believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to      accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a      clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all      claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could      ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three      thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I      thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his      society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied      to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he      assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were      exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,      and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would      present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there      could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other      person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered      father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to      comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.      His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his      circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me      to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every      appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But      last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I      must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce      me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no      doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my      junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel      Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from      school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last      summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate;      and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there      proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.      Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by      her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,      whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his      kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe      herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but      fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her      imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to      herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea      of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as      a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt      and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings      prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left      the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from      her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my      sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot      help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a      strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.      This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty      towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of      falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to      be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of every thing      concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and      suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly      wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then      master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.      For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our      near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of      the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted      with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of      _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented      by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may      be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find      some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course      of the morning. I will only add, God bless you."], "pid": 758, "liked_by": [117, 29, 200, 112, 189, 25, 38, 172, 41, 7, 123, 155, 45, 133, 17, 170, 116, 65, 93, 56, 84, 104, 186, 118, 46, 33], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/375468/pexels-photo-375468.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:758", "posted_by": 40, "collected_by": [8, 171, 75, 137, 68, 35, 124, 72, 174, 138, 42, 116, 24, 18, 66, 193, 44, 90, 156, 111, 93, 85, 23, 40, 168, 102, 34]}, {"labels": ["Mexican", "Food story", "Best Ramen Place", "Best for birthday party"], "paragraph": ["    \"FITZWILLIAM DARCY.\"", "CHAPTER XIII."], "pid": 759, "liked_by": [109, 44, 69, 89, 10, 98, 144, 45, 54, 141, 23], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/998238/pexels-photo-998238.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:759", "posted_by": 28, "collected_by": [127, 22, 135]}, {"labels": ["Mexican", "Family made", "Best for birthday party", "Drinks are good", "Best for large groups"], "paragraph": ["\"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?\" said Jane.--\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\""], "pid": 76, "liked_by": [128, 51, 115, 28, 46, 98, 34, 164, 86, 188, 138, 64, 125, 155, 160, 81, 180, 97, 56, 79, 25, 33, 70, 55, 171, 39, 137, 10, 184, 71, 21, 147, 54, 168, 69, 1, 57, 6, 76, 175, 122], "photo": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/3642030/pexels-photo-3642030.jpeg", "title": "Sample Data:76", "posted_by": 164, "collected_by": [170, 200, 145, 110, 63, 198, 181, 3, 127, 75, 143, 160, 46, 94, 83, 41, 97, 50, 175, 6, 31, 132, 20, 138, 59, 192]}, {"labels": ["Mexican", "Food therapy", "Best for birthday party", "Great restaurant"], "paragraph": ["If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.

With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.

The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.", "The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.

She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.

His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy.

Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.

Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.      Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for      there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.      Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day      before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short      letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to      Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief      that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which      was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off      from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to      Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed      into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them      from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen      to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making      every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into      Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at      the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such      people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he      came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner      most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and      Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my      dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,      but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it      more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to      pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design      against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,      can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to      find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their      marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he      feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill      and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but      this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life      saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed      their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot      wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared      something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock      is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so      selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I      take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,      but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging      you all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and      aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have      still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to      London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What      he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress      will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest      way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again      to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"", "\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.
